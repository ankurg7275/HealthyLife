    <h3>Quality of life is important for health and well-being</h3>
    <p>It’s not enough to just be alive. Good quality of life is especially important for older adults who are dealing with chronic health conditions and major life changes.<br>

Feeling satisfied and fulfilled is just as important for overall well-being as getting regular check-ups from the doctor.<br>

In fact, having a positive view of life can help seniors have more energy, less stress, better appetite, and prevent cognitive decline.<br>

We share 5 ways to help older adults improve their quality of life.</p>

<h2>1. Treat Depression</h2>
  <p>Depression late in life affects 7 million people aged 65+. It can be caused by stressful life events like retirement or losing a spouse. It could also be caused by a medical disease or medication side effects. To improve quality of life, it’s important to recognize the signs of depression and get help from a doctor, psychologist, therapist, or counselor.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Help them Feel Useful and Needed</h2>
  <p>From the very young to the very old, everyone wants to be useful. When you care for an older adult, do your best to make them feel like you still need their help and that they’re not a burden. Even if they can’t do these tasks efficiently or perfectly, that’s okay. What’s important is that they’re contributing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Folding laundry</li>
    <li>Organizing drawers</li>
    <li>Opening the mail</li>
    <li>Writing grocery or household to-do lists</li>
    <li>Clipping coupons</li>
    <li>Keeping you up to date on the news</li>
    <li>Prepping dinner – for example, trimming vegetables</li>
    <li>Going with you to help shop for groceries or run other errands</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Encourage Regular Physical Activity</h2>
  <p>Regular physical activity, no matter how gentle, helps keeps both body and mind feeling balanced and positive. Physically, exercise boosts the immune system, lowers blood pressure, improves sleep quality, improves heart health, relieves anxiety, improves strength and stamina, and more.</p>

  <h2>4. Keep Them Mentally Active</h2>
  <p>Crossword puzzles, sudoku, other brain games, reading, and writing are all great activities for mental stimulation. Having a sharp and active mind improves overall well-being.</p>

  <h2>5. Help Them Stay Connected with Family, Friends, and Community</h2>
  <p>Seniors who are isolated and lonely have shorter lives and are at greater risk for dementia. Prevent that by encouraging and helping your older adult stay connected with their community.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arrange for family and friends to visit, eat with, or take them out regularly</li>
    <li>Arrange transportation so they can go to senior centers</li>
    <li>Encourage them to attend any parties – birthday, graduation, holiday, etc.</li>
    <li>Get them involved in a hobby</li>
    <li>Encourage them to volunteer with church, community, or charity organizations</li>
  </ul>
